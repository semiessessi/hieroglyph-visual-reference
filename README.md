# Hieroglyph Visual References

Generating an easily used static webpage from a list of sources of hieroglyph images, and caching the results in case of dead links.

The source data is a list of references in a javascript data structure.

The other sources are the remainder of the webpage.

## Build steps

To build just the website scripts run `build\build.bat` in the repository root.

To build images as well (slow) run `build\build.bat images` instead.
